This is the Python 1.2 compiled with Borland C++ 3.1.
I also included the LIB files.

You must have the Python sources to make any use of those files.

I will probably release the sources of the CONFIG.C, CONFIG.H and the 
makefiles, but since I only needed it working, it's quite ugly.
You're welcome to compile it yourself - you need the sources, and DOSBUILD.
To make Python compile with you're favorite compiler, you'll have to change
CONFIG.H.
